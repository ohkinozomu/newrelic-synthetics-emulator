# newrelic-synthetics-emulator
Imitation of New Relic's request to got converter (unofficial)

## Motivation

[New Relic Synthetics uses got module in request-like experience through $http object.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/manage-monitor-runtimes/#apidependencies)

Complex processes need to be tested when run on Synthetics, but (as far as I know) `$http` is not open source.
